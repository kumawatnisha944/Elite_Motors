              Many car owners think that car service and car repair are the
              same, but they actually serve different purposes. Car servicing is
              preventive maintenance performed at regular intervals to keep the
              vehicle running smoothly. It includes checking engine oil,
              filters, brakes, tires, and battery to ensure every component is
              working properly.
            </p>

            <p>
              Car repair is needed when a specific part of the vehicle becomes
              damaged or stops working. Issues such as engine problems, clutch
              failure, overheating, or electrical faults require professional
              repair or part replacement. Unlike servicing, repair usually
              occurs after a noticeable problem or breakdown.
            </p>

            <p>
              Regular servicing helps identify minor wear and tear early and
              prevents small issues from turning into major mechanical failures.
              It improves fuel efficiency, enhances driving comfort, and
              increases the overall lifespan of the vehicle. Ignoring scheduled
              service often leads to unexpected repairs and higher expenses.
            </p>

            <p>
              Understanding the difference between servicing and repair helps
              vehicle owners take timely action and maintain their car properly.
              By servicing the car regularly and repairing faults immediately,
              drivers can ensure better performance, safety, and reliability on
              the road.

            Car owners often get confused between car service and car repair,
            but both are different and equally important for maintaining a
            vehicle. Car service is a routine maintenance process carried out at
            regular intervals to keep the vehicle in proper working condition.
            Car repair, on the other hand, is required when a particular
            component of the vehicle becomes faulty or damaged. Problems such as
            engine overheating, clutch failure, suspension issues, or electrical
            faults need proper repair or part replacement. Unlike servicing,
            repair usually happens after a breakdown or when a noticeable issue
            appears in the car.

            Why understanding car repair and car service
          </h2>

          <p>
            Many car owners believe servicing and repair are the same, but they
            are actually very different. Car servicing is regular preventive
            maintenance that keeps your vehicle running smoothly, while car
            repair is required when a specific part becomes damaged or stops
            working.
          </p>

          <p>
            Regular servicing helps detect small issues such as low engine oil,
            worn brake pads, dirty filters, or weak battery before they turn
            into serious problems. On the other hand, repair work usually
            involves replacing or fixing faulty components like the clutch,
            suspension, engine parts, or electrical systems. Understanding when
            your car needs service and when it needs repair helps improve
            vehicle performance, increases lifespan, and saves money by avoiding
            costly damage.

              Car servicing is a routine maintenance process performed at
              regular intervals to keep your vehicle in good condition. It
              includes checking engine oil, filters, brakes, battery, tires, and

            <div class="faq-question">What is car repair?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Car repair is done when a specific part of the vehicle stops
              working or gets damaged. It may include fixing engine issues,
              replacing a broken clutch, repairing suspension, or solving
              electrical problems. Unlike servicing, repair is usually required
              after a fault or breakdown occurs.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How often should a car be serviced?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Most cars should be serviced every 6 months or after driving 5,000
              to 10,000 kilometers, depending on the manufacturer’s
              recommendation. Regular servicing helps detect minor issues early
              and prevents costly repairs in the future.

            <div class="faq-question">
              Is car servicing necessary even if the car is running fine?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Yes, servicing is necessary even if the car appears to run
              perfectly. Many internal components wear out slowly and may not
              show immediate symptoms. Regular servicing maintains performance,
              improves fuel efficiency, and increases the lifespan of the
              vehicle.

              Which is more expensive: car service or car repair?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Car repair is usually more expensive than servicing because it
              involves fixing or replacing damaged parts. Servicing is
              preventive maintenance, while repair happens after a problem
              occurs. Regular servicing helps avoid major breakdowns and saves
              money in the long run.
