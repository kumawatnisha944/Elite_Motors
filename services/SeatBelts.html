    Seat belts are one of the simplest yet most effective safety features in a vehicle.
    They are designed to protect occupants by keeping them securely positioned in their
    seats during sudden braking or accidents. Without wearing a seat belt, a person can
    be thrown forward due to the force of impact, which can result in serious head, chest,
    or spinal injuries.
</p>

<p>
    Many drivers and passengers ignore seat belts, especially during short trips or while
    driving at low speeds. However, most road accidents happen unexpectedly and even at
    moderate speeds. Not wearing a seat belt increases the chances of severe injury and
    also puts other passengers at risk inside the vehicle.
</p>

<p>
    A properly worn seat belt spreads the force of a collision across stronger parts of
    the body such as the chest and hips. It also allows safety systems like airbags to
    work correctly. Without a seat belt, airbags alone cannot provide full protection and
    may not prevent injury during an impact.
</p>

<p>
    In this guide, you will learn about the importance of seat belts, their history, and
    how to use them correctly. Making seat belt use a regular habit can greatly improve
    road safety and help protect both drivers and passengers on every journey.

    <!-- ========== WHAT IS TUNE UP ========== -->
    <div class="info-container">
<h2 class="info-title">The Importance of Seat Belts</h2>


<p class="info-text">
    Seat belts are one of the most essential safety features in modern vehicles. They are
    designed to protect drivers and passengers by holding them securely in place during
    sudden stops, sharp turns, or collisions. Without a seat belt, the force of impact can
    throw a person forward into the steering wheel, dashboard, or windshield, causing serious
    head, chest, or spinal injuries.
    Over the years, advancements in automotive safety have made seat belts stronger and more
    reliable, working together with airbags and other protective systems. Wearing a seat belt
    not only reduces the chances of fatal injuries but also improves overall road safety for
    everyone inside the vehicle. Making it a habit to buckle up before every journey is a
    simple step that can save lives and ensure a safer driving experience.

<h2 class="section-heading">Why wearing a seat belt is important?</h2>

<p>
    Seat belts are a simple yet life-saving safety feature designed to protect passengers
    during sudden braking, sharp turns, or road accidents. Without a seat belt, a person can
    be thrown forward due to the force of impact, hitting the steering wheel, dashboard, or
    windshield. This can lead to severe head, chest, and spinal injuries even in low-speed
    collisions.
</p>

<p>
    Wearing a seat belt keeps the driver and passengers securely positioned in their seats
    and allows other safety systems, such as airbags, to function properly. Over the years,
    road safety studies have proven that seat belts significantly reduce the chances of fatal
    injuries.

        <h2 class="section-heading">FAQ's</h2>

<div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Why are seat belts important in a car?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        Seat belts are one of the most important safety features in a vehicle. They hold passengers securely in place during sudden braking or accidents and prevent them from hitting the dashboard, steering wheel, or windshield. Wearing a seat belt greatly reduces the risk of serious injuries and saves lives.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">When did seat belts become mandatory?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        Seat belts were introduced in cars during the 1950s, but they became mandatory in many countries during the 1970s and 1980s as governments realized their importance in road safety. Today, wearing a seat belt is required by law in most parts of the world, including India.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Do rear seat passengers also need to wear seat belts?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        Yes, rear seat passengers must also wear seat belts. In case of a sudden stop or accident, passengers sitting in the back can be thrown forward and may seriously injure themselves or others in the car. Seat belts protect everyone inside the vehicle, not just the driver.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">How does a seat belt protect you during an accident?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        A seat belt works by distributing the force of impact across stronger parts of the body such as the chest, hips, and shoulders. It also prevents the passenger from being ejected from the vehicle. This greatly lowers the chances of fatal head and spinal injuries.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Can airbags replace seat belts?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        No, airbags cannot replace seat belts. Airbags are designed to work together with seat belts, not instead of them. Without a seat belt, the airbag may not protect properly and can even cause injury. Wearing a seat belt ensures that the airbag works safely and effectively.
